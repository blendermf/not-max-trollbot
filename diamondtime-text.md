Welcome to Diamond Time, the place for you to promote your projects to the rest of the subreddit, and to all of Diamond Club through the Diamond Time portion of Night Attack.

All Diamond Time submissions must include

* an explanation of what your project is 
* how you are involved (even if it's just you, say so in some way, even if it's just wording it so that's apparent)
* why we should check it out / why it's cool 
* the link for your project inside that.

**Note** - while not an absolute requirement, please use links that are easily readible for use on the show. For some cases this may require the use of a URL shortener. One thing to keep in mind though is that posts / comments with URL shortened links get auto tagged as spam, and one of the mods has to manually approve the post (and reapprove it if such a link is added in an edit). So please keep this in mind, and be patient (or send one of us a message here or on twitter)

**Note** - these things are automated, so in the off chance that the schedule changes, and I don't know about it, or I forget to un-contest mode this before the show (because currently I can't automate that yet, at least from what I've seen), please message the moderators, or even better, send @blendermf a tweet and yell at him for pulling a kuuuhhhhHHHAAAAANNN.
